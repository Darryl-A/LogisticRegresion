1. The code is pretty straightforward since I have added comments so it should very easy to follow!
2. If my code is to be tested against some new text file, all you have to do is replace the name of the file that I imported where I have imported the test file for the project.
3. All that needs to be done to check is replace the name of the files.
4. Just compile all the code blocks and create a new file and pass this file's name in the last code block where I write the prediction to the said file. For instance, in my case I named it pred.dat and passed that in the last code block and my code copied the predictions to that file which I then uploaded on miner to check my accuracy.
